\begin{abstract}
Using a new patented process - Friction welding of tube to tube plate using an external tool (FWTPET), Ti-6Al-4V tube and AA6061-T6 tube plate were welded together. The welding was carried out at 4 different rotational speeds(560, 710, 900, 1120) with two different tube profiles (Holes and Petals). The effect of tube profile on the joint strength of the welded samples was measured using an in-house developed test procedure named ``Plunge Shear Test''. The highest strength of xxMPa was observed in petals profile welded at 1120 rpm Macro and Micro structural studies were done on the welded samples. Fractography studies were carried out on the  sheared surfaces. XRD analysis was done to identify the formation of intermetallics.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:Introduction}
Friction welding of tube to tube plate using an external tool (FWTPET) is a new solid state welding process, invented and patented by S. Muthukumaran in the year 2006. FWTPET process uses an external tool which has a shoulder and a pin. FWTPET process can be carried out in two methods - interference and clearance. Unlike FSW process, in FWTPET the tool pin acts as an anvil and does not cause any stirring action\cite{SenthilKumaran2011}. The parameters that affect the joint strength of a FWTPET welded joints are : tool rotational speed, tube profile, tool shoulder and pin dimension, heat input etc. Our aim was to increase the heat input study its effect of on joint strength. In order to increase the heat input we needed to increase the tool shoulder and tube contact area. 
Although FWTPET is a solid state welding process, in our study, during welding the temperature exceeded the melting point of the aluminium alloy. Thus our current study is a quasi-solid state welding process. 
\par 
AA6061 is a low melting soft metal whereas Ti-6Al-4V is a high melting hard material. Welding a low melting alloy (AA6061) with a high temperature material (Ti-6Al-4V) is extremely difficult by conventional fusion welding process. This leads to lesser heat generation at interface and in turn leads to lesser intermetallic formation when compared to Friction Stir Welding (FSW) processes \cite{MadhusudhanReddy2009}.

\section{Experimental Details} 
\label{sec:Experimental Details}
\subsection{Materials}
\label{subsec:Materials}
The materials used for welding were AA6061 tube plates and Titanium Grade V (Ti-6Al-4V) tubes. The base material composition of AA6061 is given in Table~\ref{table:AA6061-composition} and Ti-6Al-4V is given in Table~\ref{table:Ti-6Al-4V-composition}. The external tool used for welding was made of Tungsten alloy (Figure~\ref{fig:tool}) having 29mm shoulder diameter and 12.5 mm pin diameter. Chemical composition of the external tool is given in Table~\ref{table:tool-composition}. 
\par 
AA6061 plates of 6 mm thickness were cut into 50 x 50 mm squares. A hole of 19 mm diameter was drilled at the center of the plate. Ti-6Al-4V tube of with 19 mm outer diameter and 14 mm inner diameter were used for welding. Two tube profiles, holes and petals were used for welding.
\begin{enumerate}[1.]
\item Holes : Holes of 2 mm diameter were drilled at equal intervals along the circumference of the Ti-6Al-4V tubes of height 20 mm. The holes were made at a depth of 5 mm from top of the tube.
\item Petals : Slots of length 10 mm and width 2 mm were made at equal intervals along the circumference of the Ti-6Al-4V tubes of height 30 mm. The slots were then formed into petals using a suitable tool.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{FWTPET}
\label{subsec:FWTPET}
FWTPET process was carried out in a 4-Axis Friction Stir Welding machine (\ref{fig:fsw-machine}). Before welding, the tube and plate were cleaned with Acetone to remove dirt and grease. Then the tube and plate were fitted to a specially designed backing block as shown in \ref{fig:backing-block}. The parameter used for welding are given in Table \ref{table:process-parameters}. %The samples were welded at 4 different tool rotational speeds : 560, 710, 1120 and 1200 rpm. The parameters that were kept constant for all the welds were plunge rate - 2 mm/min, plunge depth - 2 mm and tube projection - 2 mm.

\subsection{Plunge Shear Test}
\label{subsec:Plunge Shear Test}
The joint strength of the welds were measured using an in-house developed testing procedure called ``Plunge Shear Test''. Plunge Shear Test (PST) is a destructive testing method which can be carried out on a conventional UTM with the help of an external plunger. In order to perform the PST, a specially designed half-solid and half-hollow tube must be used for welding as shown in Fig \ref{fig:pst-schematic}. After welding, the the sample is placed in a specially designed fixture and fixed to a UTM. With the help of a plunger (Fig.), a compressive load is applied on the solid part of the tube by the UTM, until the joint breaks.
\par
For our current work, for holes profile, a rod of 19 mm diameter and 30 mm length was taken and a hole of 14 mm diameter was drilled to a depth of 20 mm as shown in Fig \ref{fig:pst-schematic}. For petals profile, a rod of 19 mm diameter and 35 mm length was taken and a hole of 14 mm diameter was drilled to a depth of 20 mm as shown in Fig \ref{fig:pst-schematic}

\subsection{Characterization}
\label{subsec:Characterization}
The welded samples were sectioned at the weld joint for metallographic studies. Studies were made using a standard stereoscope and optical microscope. SEM and EDS analysis were performed to quantify the elemental weight percentage at the joint interface. The observations were carried out in a 200kV field effect scanning electron microscope (SEM-JEOL JSM 5410LV microscopy) coupled with EDS. EDS line scan was also carried out along the weld interface. XRD analysis was done at the weld interface of Al-Ti dissimilar welds. XRD analysis helps to find out the formation of intermetallic at the weld interface. Scan speed was 10º/min and step width was 0.02º. In order to reveal the microstructures, a common etchant to etch both AA6061 and Ti-6Al-4V was developed. The etchant consists of equal parts of 2-Propanol, HCl, HN0_{3} and few drops of HF. The etching time varied between 25 to 40 seconds based on the heat input on the welded samples.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%Results and Discussion%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Results and Discussion}
\label{sec:Results and Discussion}

\subsection{Macrostructure Analysis}
\label{subsec:Macrostructure Analysis}
Macrostructure analysis revealed the effect of tube profile on the metal flow in FWTPET process. for all three different tube profiles revealed defect free joints. For tube with holes profile, Aluminium is embedded in the Titanium region (Fig. 5 a,b). Plates welded with tube having petals are characterized by Titanium deposited on the surface of the Aluminium plates (Fig. 5 c).

\subsection{Microstructure Analysis}
\label{subsec:Macrostructure Analysis}
The microstructure of AA6061-T651 base metal is shown in Fig. 6. Optical micrographs of the base AA6061-T6 revealed the presence of Mg2Si precipitates which strengthens the Al alloy [4].

\subsection{Weld Strength}
\label{subsec:Weld Strength}
Using Plunge Shear Test (PST), the shear fracture load of the weld joint was obtained. The weld strength was then calculated from the shear load. For all speeds, the petals profile showed higher joint strength compared to the holes profile.  values for different tube profiles are given in Table II. From the table, it is clear that tube with petals is having high shear strength compared to other to profiles. This is due to the increase in weld area when compared to other tube profiles.



\subsection{X-Ray Diffraction Analysis}
\label{subsec:XRD-Results}
XRD plot at the weld interface for welds made with Tube with petals is shown in Fig. 12. From the XRD plot, the
presence of TiAl3 intermetallic formation was observed. Formation of intermetallic compounds is detrimental to joint strength. Titanium aluminide has three major intermetallic compounds: γ TiAl, α Ti3Al and TiAl3. Although these intermetallics have very good mechanical and thermal properties, they have very low ductility [6]. Therefore, the presence of Titanium aluminides at the interface might decrease the joint strength.

\subsection{SEM Analysis}
\label{subsec:SEM Analysis}
SEM micrograph (Fig. 13) shows the Titanium particles entirely entrapped in the Al matrix at the weld interface. It can be seen that thick mixed layers are formed on the interface. EDS Line Scanning analysis was done along the interface. EDS patterns and element contents are shown in Fig. 14.

\subsection{Fractography}
\label{subsec:Fractography}
The SEM image (Fig. 15) shows fracture surface of Titanium tube for petal profile after the PST. From the image, we can clearly see some areas on the fracture surface where the aluminum alloy is still bonded to Titanium. SEM images of the fracture surface on the Aluminum plate shows cleavage facets, which is an indication shear fracture [7],[8]. Some Titanium particles embedded in the Aluminium matrix are also visible in
the SEM images (Fig. 16 b).

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:Conclusion}
\begin{enumerate}[1.]
\item FWTPET method has been established to join 6mm thick Aluminum (AA6061-T651) tube plate to Titanium (Ti-6Al-4V) tubes of 2.5mm wall thickness.
\item Three different tube profiles-hole, slot and petals, were used to study the feasibility of joining dissimilar materials (Al-Ti) using FWTPET and petal profile was found to have good strength.
\item Shear strength of the joint reached 60% of AA6061–T651 base material strength.
\item XRD analysis showed formation of TiAl3 at the interface. Intermetallic compounds at the interface were less when compared to traditional fusion welding processes which is due to the reduction in heat generation during the welding process.
