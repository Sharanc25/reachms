%% natbib.sty is loaded by default. However, natbib options can be
%% provided with \biboptions{...} command. Following options are
%% valid:

%%   round  -  round parentheses are used (default)
%%   square -  square brackets are used   [option]
%%   curly  -  curly braces are used      {option}
%%   angle  -  angle brackets are used    <option>
%%   semicolon  -  multiple citations separated by semi-colon
%%   colon  - same as semicolon, an earlier confusion
%%   comma  -  separated by comma
%%   numbers-  selects numerical citations
%%   super  -  numerical citations as superscripts
%%   sort   -  sorts multiple citations according to order in ref. list
%%   sort&compress   -  like sort, but also compresses numerical citations
%%   compress - compresses without sorting
%%

Aluminium 6061-T651 plates of 6 mm thickness and Titanium Grade V(Ti-6Al-4V) tubes of 19 mm outer diameter were used. Tungsten Heavy alloy tool with composition - W(90.5\%), Ni(5.3\%), Co(0.2\%), Fe(3.4\%) and O(0.07\%) was used for welding. The dimensions of tool used is given in table~\ref{tab:tool}.
