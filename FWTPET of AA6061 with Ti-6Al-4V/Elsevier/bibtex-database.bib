abstract = {This work studies the effect of a post-weld heat treatment (PWHT) on the mechanical and microstructure properties of an AA6061 sample welded using the gas metal arc welding (GMAW) cold metal transfer (CMT) method. The CMT method was used because the method provides spatter-free welding, outstanding gap bridging properties, low heat input and a high degree of process flexibility. The welded samples were divided into as-welded and PWHT samples. The PWHTs used on the samples were solution heat treatment, water quenching and artificial aging. Both welded samples were cut according to the ASTM E8M-04 standard to obtain the tensile strength and the elongation of the joints. The failure pattern of the tensile tested specimens was analysed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). A Vickers microhardness testing machine was used to measure the hardness across the joints. From the results, the PWHTs were able to enhance the mechanical properties and microstructure characteristics of the AA6061 joints welded by the GMAW CMT method. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {In explosive welding process, the controlled energy of explosives is used to create a metallurgical bond between two similar or dissimilar materials. This paper presents the analytical calculation for determination of weldability domain or welding window. The analytical calculations are in good agreement with experimental results. The welding conditions are tailored through parallel geometry route with different explosive loads. The study was also conducted to consider the effects of explosive loading on the bonding interface and the characterization of explosive welding experiments carried out under different conditions. Optical microscopy studies show that a transition from a smooth interface to a wavy one occurs with increase in explosive load. Scanning electron microscopy studies show that the interface was outlined by characteristic sharp transition between two materials, but local melted zones were also encountered in the front slope of waves in the interface at high explosive loads. XRD studies detected no intermetallic phases for specimen welded at low explosive load. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {This paper reports on a numerical and experimental investigation of laser welding of titanium alloy (Ti6Al4V) for modeling the temperature distribution to predict the heat affected zone (HAZ), depth and width of the molten pool. This is a transient three-dimensional problem in which, because of simplicity, the weld pool surface is considered flat. The complex physical phenomenon causing the formation of keyhole has not been considered. The temperature histories of welding process were studied. It was observed that the finite volume thermal model was in good agreement with the experimental data. Also, we predicted the temperature as a function of distance at different laser welding speeds and saw that at each welding speed, the temperature profile was decreased sharply in points close to the laser beam center, and then decreased slightly in the far region from the laser beam center. The model prediction error was found to be in the 2–17\% range with most numerical values falling within 7\% of the experimental values.},

abstract = {The high strength to weight ratio and excellent corrosion resistance of titanium alloys allow diverse application in various fields including the medical and aerospace industry. Several techniques have been considered to achieve reliable welds with minimum distortion for the fabrication of components in these industries. Of these techniques, laser welding can provide a significant benefit for the welding of titanium alloys because of its precision and rapid processing capability. For pulse mode Nd:YAG laser welding, pulse shape, energy, duration, repetition rate and peak power are the most important parameters that influence directly or synergistically the quality of pulsed seam welds. In this study, experimental work involved examination of the welding parameters for joining a 3-mm thick titanium alloy using the Lumonics JK760TR Nd:YAG pulsed laser. It has been determined that the ratio between the pulse energy and pulse duration is the most important parameter in defining the penetration depth. Also it has been observed the variation of pulse duration at constant peak power has no influence on the penetration depth. Consequently, to increase the penetration depth during welding, the role of the laser parameters such as pulse energy and duration and peak power have been investigated to join 3 mm thick Ti6Al4V. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Pulsed current gas tungsten arc welding was used to fabricate the joints. To optimize the number of experiments to be performed, central composite design was used. The investigation revealed increase in corrosion resistance with increase in peak current and pulse frequency up to an optimum value of the same and decrease in corrosion resistance beyond that optimum point.

The ultimate tensile strength was approximately 91\% in HFSW welds by that of the Al alloy base metal, which was 24\% higher than that of FSW welds without GTAW under same welding condition. Notably, it was found that elongation in HFSW welds increased significantly compared with that of FSW welds, which resulted in improved joint strength.

abstract = {Friction Stir Welding (FSW) is a solid state welding process patented in 1991 by TWI; initially adopted to weld aluminum alloys, it is now being successfully used also for high resistant materials. Welding of titanium alloys by traditional fusion welding techniques presents several difficulties due to high material reactivity with oxygen, hydrogen, and nitrogen with consequent embrittlement of the joint. In this way FSW represents a cost effective and high quality solution. The final mechanical properties of the joints are strictly connected to the microstructural evolutions, in terms of phase change, occurring during the process. In the paper a 3D FEM model of the FSW welding process, based on a thermo-mechanical fully coupled analysis, is presented. The model, tuned both for the thermo-mechanical analysis and the phase transformation through experimental data, is able to predict the phase volume fraction in the typical zones of the joints at the varying of the main process parameters. The obtained results permit to assess that the tuned FEM model of the FSW process can be utilized as an effective design tool. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Heterogeneous interfacial reactions were easily found along the Ti/Al interface due to high temperature gradient during laser welding-brazing of Ti/Al dissimilar alloys. To improve the nonhomogeneity, relative uniform energy distribution of laser beam and appropriate groove were attempted. The effects of these attempts on the nonhomogeneity of interfacial reactions were investigated by finite element method (FEM) numerical simulation and experimental validation. The results indicate that the V-shaped groove can make the interface roughly parallel to the isotherm of the temperature field. Moreover, the rectangular spot laser can further improve homogenization of the interfacial reaction along the interface in comparison with circular spot laser. Tensile test results show that the combination of rectangular spot laser welding-brazing and V-shaped groove can effectively control the fracture of Ti/Al joints in the seam in a wide processing parameters window, and the average tensile strength reaches 278.

abstract = {We have developed a cleaning procedure for aluminum alloys for effective minimization of surface-adsorbed sub-micrometer particles and nonvolatile residue. The procedure consists of a phosphoric acid etch followed by an alkaline detergent wash. To better understand the mechanism whereby this procedure reduces surface contaminants, we characterized the aluminum surface as a function of cleaning step using surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS). SERS indicates that phosphoric acid etching re-establishes a surface oxide of different characteristics, including deposition of phosphate and increased hydration, while the subsequent alkaline detergent wash appears to remove the phosphate and modify the new surface oxide, possibly leading to a more compact surface oxide. We also studied the zeta potential of <5 microm pure aluminum and aluminum alloy 6061-T6 particles to determine how surface electrostatics may be affected during the cleaning process. The particles show a decrease in the magnitude of their zeta potential in the presence of detergent, and this effect is most pronounced for particles that have been etched with phosphoric acid.},

abstract = {In this study, the relationship between microstructures and mechanical properties of the cross-channel extrusion (CCE) processed AA6061 alloy caused by different heat treatments were investigated. The ultimate tensile strength of the homogenized AA6061 can be strengthening to 194 MPa after extruded at 448 K for 8 passes. After T6 treatment, the strength was increased from 194 to 323 MPa caused by the formation of fine precipitates; however, the grains were coarsened. The Post-CCE aging treatment was applied on AA6061 alloy that the alloy was processed in supersaturated state at 448 K for 8 passes, and then artificial aged. A higher tensile strength of 364 MPa which is 13\% higher when compared with the T6 treated sample was obtained since it consisted of fine-grained matrix with grain structure size of 0.2-0.5 ??m and precipitation hardening effect. It demonstrates that the Post-CCE aging treatment is a suitable method for producing a heat treatable Al alloy with improved strength when applied to CCE process. ?? 2008.},

Tensile properties such as yield strength, tensile strength, elongation and joint efficiency were evaluated. Microstructures of the welded joints were analyzed using optical microscopy and transmission electron microscopy.

abstract = {Bacterial contamination of implanted devices is a common cause of their failure. The aim of the present study was to assess the capability of electrochemical procedures to: (a) promote the formation of anatase on the surface of commercially pure Grade 2 Ti and Ti Grade 5 (Ti6Al4V) alloy; (b) inhibit in vitro biofilm formation of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus mutans and Porphyromonas gingivalis and oral plaque in vivo, (c) preserve favorable response of osteoblasts and fibroblasts to materials surfaces. Ti Grade 2 and Ti Grade 5 were respectively anodized at two different voltages: 90 and 130 V for pure titanium; 100 and 120 V for Ti6Al4V alloy. Surface characterization was performed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) equipped with EDS probe, laser profilometry and X-ray diffractometry. Bacterial adhesion characterization was performed either in vitro and in vivo in patients. Osteoblast and fibroblast response was evaluated by metabolic activity assessment. The higher voltage applied in the anodization treatment of pure titanium (130 V) and Ti6Al4V alloy (120 V) surfaces, compared to the untreated pure titanium and Ti6Al4V and to lower voltage treatments, resulted in a greater decrease in bacterial attachment and biofilm formation in both in vitro and in vivo experiments. In contrast, the high voltage treatments were found to promote osteoblasts and fibroblasts proliferation. The observations indicated that the experimented high voltage anodization treatments may contribute to preserve the tissue integration and reduce bacteria colonization of titanium and titanium alloy for implantable applications. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

In this study, stainless steel-titanium plates were joined explosively employing oblique geometry route at different explosive ratios. The bonding was investigated using optical and scanning electron microscopy and tensile-shearing, bending, hardness and corrosion tests were carried out. Optical and scanning electron microscopy examinations showed that a transition was observed from smooth bonding interface to a wavy one with increasing explosive ratio. It was also observed that grains near the interface were elongated parallel to the explosion direction. No shearing within the interface was seen from the tensile-shear tests and fracture took place within the low strength material. The bended specimens showed that defects such as separation and tearing were not observed. Hardness was increased with increasing explosive ratio and the highest hardness values were obtained near the bonding interface. Weight increase due to formation of a stable oxide layer on the welded stainless steel-titanium plates was seen from corrosion tests while weight loss was seen from the other specimens and this loss was increased with increasing explosive ratio. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Fiber laser-gas metal arc (GMA) hybrid welding process was introduced to weld of commercially pure titanium (CP-Ti) of 1.5 mm in thickness. Effect of welding parameters on the hybrid weldability was investigated concerning the bead shape, hardness, tensile properties and microstructures of welded joints compared with those of a fiber laser welded joint. As a result, fiber laser-GMA hybrid welding process has been shown to weld of CP-Ti sheets in 1.5mm thickness at speeds of up to 9 m/min. In addition, fiber laser-GMA hybrid welding produces higher Vickers hardness and tensile strength than that of the base metal. Compared with the laser welded joints, it is obvious that the hybrid welded joints have better combination of strength and ductility. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The present paper tries to summarize the relationship between processing, microstructure, and mechanical properties of two-phase ($\alpha$+$\beta$) titanium alloys. Although for most structural applications of titanium alloys a variety of important mechanical properties (yield stress, ductility, HCF, LCF, da/dN of micro- and macrocracks, KIC, and creep) have to be optimized or balanced, and although both processing as well as microstructure contain many variables, it can be shown that from the numerous correlation possibilities only a few underlying basic principles are really important. One of them is the relationship between cooling rate, colony size, and slip length leading directly to the advantages of a bi-modal (duplex) type of microstructure usable for most applications and involving a reproducible and insensitive processing route.},

The Ar-4\% H2 gas was more effective in preventing oxidization of beads than Ar gas. Simple 3D titanium objects with arch, arabic numerals and pyramidal shapes were formed. Fine needle-like solidification structure of ??-phase titanium were developed during bead formation due to the rapid cooling of the melt.

abstract = {The influence of operational parameters on the local phase composition and mechanical stability of the electron beam welds between titanium alloy and AISI 316L austenitic stainless steel with a copper foil as an intermediate layer has been studied.It was shown that two types of weld morphologies could be obtained depending on beam offset from the center line. Beam shift toward the titanium alloy side results in formation of a large amount of the brittle TiFe2 phase, which is located at the steel/melted zone interface and leads to reducing the mechanical resistance of the weld. Beam shift toward the steel side inhibits the melting of titanium alloy and, so, the formation of brittle intermetallics at the titanium alloy/melted zone interface. Mechanical stability of the obtained junctions was shown to depend on the thickness of this intermetallic layer. The fracture zone of the weld was found to be a mixture of TiCu (3-42wt\%), TiCu1-xFex (x=0.72-0.84) (22-68wt\%) and TiCu1-xFex (x=0.09-0.034) (0-22wt\%). In order to achieve the maximal ultimate tensile strength (350MPa), the diffusion path length of Ti in the melted zone should be equal to 40-80??m. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The present work shows that optimization of mechanical properties via heat treatment of parts produced by Selective Laser Melting (SLM) is profoundly different compared to conventionally processed Ti6Al4V. In order to obtain optimal mechanical properties, specific treatments are necessary due to the specific microstructure resulting from the SLM process. SLM is an additive manufacturing technique through which components are built by selectively melting powder layers with a focused laser beam. The process is characterized by short laser-powder interaction times and localized high heat input, which leads to steep thermal gradients, rapid solidification and fast cooling. In this research, the effect of several heat treatments on the microstructure and mechanical properties of Ti6Al4V processed by SLM is studied. A comparison is made with the effect of these treatments on hot forged and subsequently mill annealed Ti6Al4V with an original equiaxed microstructure. For SLM produced parts, the original martensite $\alpha$′ phase is converted to a lamellar mixture of $\alpha$ and $\beta$ for heat treating temperatures below the $\beta$-transus (995°C), but features of the original microstructure are maintained. Treated above the $\beta$-transus, extensive grain growth occurs and large $\beta$ grains are formed which transform to lamellar $\alpha$+$\beta$ upon cooling. Post treating at 850°C for 2h, followed by furnace cooling increased the ductility of SLM parts to 12.84±1.36\%, compared to 7.36±1.32\% for as-built parts.},

abstract = {Electron beam welding experiments of titanium alloy to stainless steel were carried out with different filler metals, such as Ni, V, and Cu. Microstructures of the joints were examined by optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction analysis. Mechanical properties of the joints were evaluated according to tensile strength and microhardness. As a result, influences of filler metals on microstructures and mechanical properties of electron beam welded titanium-stainless steel joints were discussed. The results showed that all the filler metals were helpful to restrain the Ti-Fe intermetallics. The welds with different filler metals were all characterized by solid solution and interfacial intermetallics. For each type of the filler metal, the type of solid solution and interfacial intermetallics depended on the metallurgical reactions between the filler metals and base metals. The interfacial intermetallics were Fe2Ti+Ni3Ti+NiTi 2, TiFe, and Cu2Ti+CuTi+CuTi2 in the joints welded with Ni, V, and Cu filler metals, respectively. The tensile strengths of the joints were dependent on the hardness of the interfacial intermetallics. The joint welded with Ag filler metal had the highest tensile strength, which is about 310 MPa. ?? 2014 The Nonferrous Metals Society of China.},
